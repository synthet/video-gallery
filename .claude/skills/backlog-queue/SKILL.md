# Backlog queue (Claude Code mirror)

> The canonical task queue is the GitHub Project board:
> **https://github.com/users/synthet/projects/1**
>
> It spans both repos: `synthet/video-gallery` (this repo) and `synthet/image-scoring-backend`.
> The repo `TODO.md` files are pointers only — **never** add tasks there.

## When to use

- The user asks to pick the next task, start work, or "what's next".
- The user asks to file a new backlog item.
- A PR is being prepared and needs a `Closes #N` reference.
- A task has hit a blocker, is ready for review, or is finished.
- An agent picks up a task without a corresponding issue — stop and file one first.

## Five-step contract

1. **Pick from `Stage = Ready`** (sorted by `priority:p0..p3`). If empty, stop — do not invent work.
2. **Claim**: `/task-claim <N>` (preferred) or the manual `gh` flow below. Adds you as assignee + moves the card to `Claimed`.
3. **Flip `Stage = In Progress`** on the first commit.
4. **If blocked**: move to `Stage = Blocked` *and* leave a comment with the reason and what would unblock it.
5. **PR description must include `Closes #<N>`**. Move card to `Stage = Review` while open; merging closes the issue and flips `Status = Done` (manually move `Stage = Done`).

## Manual `gh` workflow

```bash
REPO="video-gallery"   # or image-scoring-backend
N=<issue-number>

gh issue view "$N" --repo "synthet/$REPO" --json number,state,assignees,title
gh issue edit "$N" --repo "synthet/$REPO" --add-assignee @me

ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 1 --owner synthet --format json --limit 200 \
  | jq -r --argjson n "$N" --arg repo "$REPO" \
      '.items[] | select(.content.number==$n) | select((.content.repository // "") | endswith($repo)) | .id')

gh project item-edit --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --project-id PVT_kwHOAFXgIs4BWC3c \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAFXgIs4BWC3czhRaNZ0 \
  --single-select-option-id 1cc70f0b   # Claimed
```
